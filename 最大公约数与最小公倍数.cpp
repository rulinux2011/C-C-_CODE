问题 A: Least Common Multiple
题目描述
The least common multiple (LCM) of a set of positive integers is the smallest positive integer which is divisible by all the numbers in the set. For example, the LCM of 5, 7 and 15 is 105.

输入
Input will consist of multiple problem instances. The first line of the input will contain a single integer indicating the number of problem instances. Each instance will consist of a single line of the form m n1 n2 n3 ... nm where m is the number of integers in the set and n1 ... nm are the integers. All integers will be positive and lie within the range of a 32-bit integer.

输出
For each problem instance, output a single line containing the corresponding LCM. All results will lie in the range of a 32-bit integer.
